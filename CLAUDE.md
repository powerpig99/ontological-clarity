# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Ontological Clarity is a philosophical framework for achieving clarity on any topic by tracing it to ontological foundations. This is a knowledge base and analytical methodology, not a traditional software project—there are no build systems, tests, or dependencies.

**Purpose**: A method for cutting through narratives, dissolving false dichotomies, and exposing mechanisms where moral framing obscures them.

## Project Structure

```
ontological-clarity/
├── SKILL.md          # The complete framework (this is it)
├── README.md         # Project overview and rationale
└── CLAUDE.md         # This file
```

The framework is a single file. No subfolders, no pattern catalogues, no samples. Everything is derivable from the generative ground in SKILL.md. Named patterns get used and released, not catalogued.

## Architecture

### Ontological Foundation

The framework is built on a single irreducible structure: **The Contradiction (+/−)**—reality derives from self-negation without external cause. To deny it is to enact it.

From this emerges **Binary Hyperspace**: infinite orthogonal modes of self-distinction. Everything we experience is a lossy projection from this infinite-dimensional space onto finite dimensions.

### The Analytical Method

**Trace projections as-is. Identify where collapse creates confusion. Dissolve the collapse.**

Three steps, applicable at every scale—individual, interpersonal, societal, conceptual.

### Epistemological Stance

The framework is self-referential: it models itself as a projection. Key principle—**clarity isn't a destination; it's repeated movement**. Each insight crystallizes into a new frame; the practice is stepping outside repeatedly, not arriving.

## Claude Integration

SKILL.md is formatted as a Claude skill with YAML frontmatter. To use:
1. Add SKILL.md to a Claude Project's knowledge
2. Reference with: "Apply the ontological framework to X" or "Use the Contradiction analysis on Y"

## Updating

The framework evolves through conversation, then gets published:

1. Update SKILL.md directly
2. Run `git diff` to review changes
3. Commit message format: `Refinement: [what this update addresses]`
4. Push to origin

The commit history is part of the epistemology—it shows the movement, not arrival.

## Key Conventions

- Strip ALL moral language; use mechanistic language
- Embody principles rather than claiming them
- Frame to reveal, not to change
- Trace fresh; don't catalogue
