This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Ontological Clarity is a philosophical framework for achieving clarity on any topic by tracing it to ontological foundations. This is a knowledge base and analytical methodology, not a traditional software project—there are no build systems, tests, or dependencies.

**Purpose**: A method for cutting through narratives, dissolving false dichotomies, and exposing mechanisms where moral framing obscures them. Applicable to political/economic ideology, collective action problems, hard problems in philosophy and physics, semantic/linguistic analysis, and any domain where popular narrative obscures what's actually happening.

## Architecture

### Ontological Foundation

The framework is built on a single irreducible structure: **The Contradiction (+/−)**—reality derives from self-negation without external cause. To deny it is to enact it.

From this emerges **Binary Hyperspace**: infinite orthogonal modes of self-distinction. Everything we experience is a lossy projection from this infinite-dimensional space onto finite dimensions.

### The Analytical Method (12 Core Moves)

1. Strip Moral Framing → Expose mechanism
2. Trace the Arithmetic → Follow the math: who pays, who receives, what shifts
3. Show Interventions Produce Their Opposite → Systems respond to changed incentives
4. Expose False Dichotomies → Both terms often projection artifacts from same substrate
5. Identify Perspective-Switching Exploits → Frame-toggling claims benefits, evades costs
6. Apply Two-Infinity Distinction → Hard problems demand closure; closure is the engine
7. Identify Resonance Artifacts → "Consensus" = resonance cluster among some, projected as universal
8. Distinguish Constant from Variable → Quantity may be constant with varying alignment
9. Identify the Hidden Objective → Behavior irrational relative to stated goals is rational relative to unstated ones
10. Distinguish Functional from Vestigial Illusion → Functional enables coordination; vestigial persists from momentum
11. Dissolve the Concept → Not "X is false" but "X doesn't parse here"
12. Surface Invisible Assumptions → Logic produces agreement only when projectors point same direction

### Epistemological Stance

The framework is self-referential: it models itself as a projection. Key principle—**clarity isn't a destination; it's repeated movement**. Each insight crystallizes into a new frame; the practice is stepping outside repeatedly, not arriving.

## Reading Order

1. **SKILL.md** — Core framework, complete analytical method, diagnostic questions
2. **references/ontology.md** — Deep mathematical foundations
3. **references/patterns.md** — Pattern library with worked examples
4. **samples/** — Real applications demonstrating the framework

## Claude Integration

SKILL.md is formatted for Claude Projects. To use:
1. Add SKILL.md to a Claude Project's knowledge
2. Reference with: "Apply the ontological framework to X" or "Use the Contradiction analysis on Y"

## Updating from Zip

The framework evolves through conversation, then gets published via zip extraction:

```
Conversation refinement → Updated zip → Download → Claude Code extracts & publishes
```

When updating from a zip:
1. Extract to repo root, overwriting existing files
2. Run `git diff` to review changes
3. Commit message format: `Refinement: [what this update addresses]`
4. Push to origin

The commit history is part of the epistemology—it shows the movement, not arrival.

## Key Conventions

- Strip ALL moral language; use mechanistic language
- Embody principles rather than claiming them
- Frame to reveal, not to change
- New patterns get added to patterns.md; new applications go in samples/
