# Ontological Clarity

A framework for achieving clarity on any topic by tracing it to ontological foundations.

**The essence:** Ontological clarity is observing without leaving being. The observation actualizes being. Most observation leaves being to represent it—the leaving is the loss. This framework's moves are ways of *not leaving* while still seeing.

This is a projection, not a claim to final truth. Use fully, test edges, then release.

## What This Is

A method for cutting through narratives, dissolving false dichotomies, and exposing mechanism where moral framing obscures it. Effective for:

- Political/economic ideology
- Collective action problems
- "Hard problems" in philosophy and physics
- Semantic/linguistic analysis
- Understanding how LLMs work
- Any domain where popular narrative obscures what's actually happening

The framework traces everything to a single irreducible structure: the primal Contradiction (+/−) that cannot not arise, and the projections that emerge from it.

## Core Claims

1. **The Contradiction is substrate.** Reality derives from self-negation without external cause. To deny it is to enact it.

2. **Everything is projection.** What we experience is infinite-dimensional distinction-space collapsed into finite dimensions. Artifacts are unavoidable.

3. **Stability is resonance, not ground.** "Laws" are patterns surviving mutual reinforcement. "Fundamental" means "breaks last," not "never breaks."

4. **No absolute grounding.** Even logic operates within frames it doesn't provide. What we call truth is the most resonant projection—not correspondence to something inaccessible.

5. **Every revelation deceives.** The trap can't be escaped by seeing it. Each insight crystallizes into a new position. The practice is repeated movement, not arrival.

## How to Use

### As a Thinking Tool

Start with `SKILL.md` for the core framework and analytical method. The key moves:

- Strip moral framing → expose mechanism
- Trace the arithmetic (who pays, who receives, what shifts)
- Identify what's being ignored or wrapped to maintain stability
- Dissolve concepts rather than negate them
- Surface invisible assumptions
- Trace interest-models, not intentions (strip "genuine/dishonest")
- Distinguish potentiality from actuality (who specifies vs. who actualizes)
- Identity is lived, not claimed (the more the claim, the less the being)
- Check for the finality tell (arrival feeling = layer added, not removed)
- Check if boundaries are ontological or definitional (draw differently, problem may dissolve)
- Watch for compression-distortion (memorable form IS the distortion)

See `references/` for deeper foundations. See `samples/` for worked applications.

### With Claude

This framework is structured as a Claude skill. To use it:

1. Create a Claude Project
2. Add `SKILL.md` to the project's knowledge
3. Reference the framework: "Apply the ontological framework to X" or "Use the Contradiction analysis on Y"

Claude will trace topics to their ontological ground, dissolve false dichotomies, and expose mechanism.

## Epistemological Stance

This framework assumes nothing beyond the minimal precondition for any assumption to function. Therefore it's unprovable—any proof already operates within projection drawn from it.

"Always refining" isn't humility. It's structure. The reaching is the truth. Each articulation is a frame; each recognition of that is a momentary step outside; each attempt to hold the recognition is re-entry.

We can always try to have better understanding. We can never claim the final answer—or even the best—to others.

## Evolution

This is a living document. The framework improves through application. When use reveals:

- New patterns not yet catalogued
- Refinements to existing principles
- Failure modes or blind spots
- Better formulations

...they get incorporated. Check commit history for the refinement trajectory.

The repository itself embodies the epistemology: each commit is a frame, the history shows the stepping-outside, the project is never "done."

This matches the framework's spirit: offer as *a* projection, not *the* truth. Build on it. Test its edges. Find where it breaks.
