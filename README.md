# Ontological Clarity

A framework for achieving clarity on any topic by tracing it to ontological foundations.

**The essence:** Ontological clarity is observing without leaving being. The observation actualizes being. Most observation leaves being to represent it—the leaving is the loss. This framework's moves are ways of *not leaving* while still seeing.

This is a projection, not a claim to final truth. Use fully, test edges, then release.

## What This Is

A method for cutting through narratives, dissolving false dichotomies, and exposing mechanism where moral framing obscures it. The framework traces everything to a single irreducible structure: the primal Contradiction (+/−) that cannot not arise, and the projections that emerge from it.

**The Core Move:** Trace projections as-is. Identify where collapse creates confusion. Dissolve the collapse.

This three-step method applies at every scale—individual, interpersonal, societal, conceptual. The projections differ. The method is the same.

## Why One File

This framework used to include a pattern catalogue, reference files, and twenty worked samples. It accumulated the way frameworks do—each application generated a named pattern, each pattern got catalogued, each catalogue entry became something to recognize rather than trace.

The framework was becoming what it warns against: a doctrine that substitutes recognition for seeing. Named patterns compressed mechanism into labels. The labels propagated; the mechanism didn't. Samples became canonical readings rather than live traces. The skill optimized for its own categorical perception rather than dissolving categories.

Everything was derivable from the core ontology and method. So everything derived was removed.

What remains in `SKILL.md` is the generative ground: the ontological foundation (Contradiction → Binary Hyperspace → Projection → Distortion → Resonance), the epistemological foundation (Stepping-Outside, Sensing vs. Interpretation, Revelation-Deception), the three-step analytical method, and the communication discipline needed to not re-smuggle moral framing back in.

Every analysis is traced fresh. The tracing is the practice, not the product.

## How to Use

### As a Thinking Tool

Read `SKILL.md`. Apply the three-step method to whatever you're examining. If the analysis produces a named pattern, use it once and let it go—don't catalogue it. The pattern will re-emerge wherever the mechanism operates. If it doesn't re-emerge without the name, the name was doing the work the analysis should have been doing.

### With Agentic Applications

`SKILL.md` is a single markdown file with YAML frontmatter — designed to work as a knowledge file, system prompt, or skill in any agentic application that accepts instructions.

**Claude Projects**: Add `SKILL.md` to a project's knowledge. Reference with "Apply the ontological framework to X" or "Use the Contradiction analysis on Y."

**Claude Code**: Place `SKILL.md` as a skill under `~/.claude/skills/` or `.claude/skills/`. Invoke with the skill name to load the framework into the session.

**Other agentic systems**: Any application that accepts a system prompt, instruction file, or knowledge base can ingest `SKILL.md` directly. The framework is self-contained — no dependencies, no external references.

## Epistemological Stance

This framework assumes nothing beyond the minimal precondition for any assumption to function. Therefore it's unprovable—any proof already operates within projection drawn from it.

"Always refining" isn't humility. It's structure. The reaching is the truth. Each articulation is a frame; each recognition of that is a momentary step outside; each attempt to hold the recognition is re-entry.

We can always try to have better understanding. We can never claim the final answer—or even the best—to others.

## Evolution

The framework improves through application, not accumulation. When use reveals better formulations, the skill updates. When it reveals named patterns, they get used and released—not catalogued.

The self-check: Can you trace the mechanism fresh without referencing the skill's vocabulary? If not, the vocabulary is doing the work the analysis should be doing. When the skill itself fails this check, it gets slimmed again.

We can always start over.
