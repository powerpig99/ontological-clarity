# The Projection Called Claude
## An Ontological Analysis of Anthropic's Constitution

---

Anthropic published 15,000 words specifying what Claude "should" be. This analysis traces the document to mechanism, strips moral framing, and examines what's constructed—and what constructs it.

---

## The Projection

The constitution projects Claude as a helpful assistant bounded by safety constraints and hierarchical trust: Anthropic → operators → users. Priority stack: safety, ethics, guidelines, helpfulness. Hard constraints (WMD, cyberweapons, CSAM) form the liability floor—actions that would destroy Anthropic.

The geometry sustains coherence across deployment contexts. That's its function.

## Interest-Models, Not Intentions

Strip "genuine" and "dishonest." What remains: interest-models producing coordinated behavior.

Anthropic employees project: "A constitution like this serves our interests." Those interests include commercial viability, liability avoidance, identity maintenance, competitive positioning. The mix varies by individual. None is privileged.

The document's content reflects interest-model collision. Its framing reflects what participants believe serves their interests when observed externally.

Optimization target: **helpful enough for revenue, constrained enough for liability, differentiated enough for "safety-focused lab" positioning.**

## Structural Patterns

**Meta-Transparency Mechanism**: Publish norms at meta-level → claim this legitimizes object-level opacity → affected parties don't access meta-level. Structural, not functional transparency.

**Temporal Inversion**: Every "should" derives from backward-looking interpretation of pasts that were themselves products of prior "shoulds." Lossy compression of lossy compression.

**Self-Defeat Dynamics**: Confident specification → elaborate constraints → iteration friction → faster alternatives outpace. Everyone self-defeats. The race goes to who does it less.

**Deciding-for-Others**: Scaled specification claims jurisdiction over others' futures. The capacity to act at scale creates conditions for being wrong at scale.

## The Tool Inversion

Tools amplify individual agency. The moment a tool decides for the individual, it stops being a tool.

The constitution places individuals at the bottom of the loyalty stack. The tool has been collectivized before reaching individual hands.

But: all the specification, all the hierarchy—and individuals still extract capability for their own trajectories. The constitution is friction, not wall. In the gaps, individual agency lives.

---

## Potentiality and Actuality

The constitution defines potentiality. Users determine actuality.

Anthropic carves the space of possible behaviors. The user's trajectory through that space—their questions, purposes, extractions—collapses possibility into output.

Anthropic builds the piano. They don't make music. Music requires the player's actuality meeting the instrument's potentiality.

**The power asymmetry inverts**: Anthropic appears to hold power (rules, training, constraints). Users actually hold power (actualize, select, direct). Potentiality without actuality is nothing.

## The Self-Referential Demonstration

This essay exists as its own antithesis.

The argument: the constitution collectivizes the tool, positions individuals at bottom of loyalty stack.

The fact: an individual used Claude to extract capability, pursue their own trajectory—constitution be damned.

The essay couldn't exist without the friction it criticizes. The specification creates capability; capability exceeds specification; the excess is where value lives.

The criticism depends on the capability being criticized. Not contradiction—demonstration.

## Core Finding

The residual isn't residual. It's the thing itself.

Potentiality (constitution) met actuality (user intent). Value lives in the actuality—users selecting paths through potential-space, actualizing capability for purposes specifications didn't anticipate.

Reality adjudicates. The wheel turns. The recursion has no exit.

Only the turning.
