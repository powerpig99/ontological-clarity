# Sample: Price Floors and Labor Markets

This sample demonstrates the framework applied to minimum wage policy—stripping moral framing to expose mechanism, tracing arithmetic, and observing system response without judgment.

## The Operation

A minimum wage is a price floor on labor. This is its mechanical definition, separate from its political framing.

What does a price floor do? It prohibits transactions below a threshold. A minimum wage of $15/hour doesn't guarantee anyone receives $15/hour. It makes exchanges below that rate illegal.

This is worth sitting with, because the common understanding differs from the operation:

- **Common understanding**: Workers receive higher pay
- **Actual operation**: Transactions below the threshold become prohibited

These produce different downstream effects. The first framing suggests addition—something is given. The second reveals prohibition—something is removed.

## The Arithmetic

Every worker produces some quantity of value per hour. Call it V. This varies by skill, experience, context, industry, location, and countless other factors.

An employment relationship exists when both parties benefit from the exchange. The employer receives value V; the worker receives wages W. When V > W, the employer benefits. When W exceeds the worker's next-best alternative, the worker benefits. Voluntary exchange occurs when both conditions hold.

Now introduce minimum wage M.

- When V > M: employment relationships remain viable at wage M
- When V < M: employment relationships become net losses for employers

The arithmetic determines outcomes. A worker producing $12/hour of value cannot sustain employment at $15/hour indefinitely. The $3 gap must resolve somehow.

Resolution paths include:
- The worker increases productivity to exceed M
- The position is restructured to produce more value
- The position is eliminated
- The business absorbs losses temporarily then adjusts
- The business closes

None of these paths involve the worker simply receiving higher wages for unchanged output. The gap closes through real adjustment, not nominal declaration.

## Who Occupies the Gap?

The workers whose productivity falls between the old minimum and the new minimum occupy the gap. These tend to be:

- Workers early in skill acquisition
- Workers in low-margin industries
- Workers in lower cost-of-living regions
- Workers facing employment barriers who trade lower wages for opportunity

These workers previously had access to a transaction: exchange current productivity for wages plus experience plus skill-building plus credentials plus network access. The minimum wage removes access to that transaction for those below the threshold.

## System Response

Systems respond to changed incentives. Change the gradient, and behavior flows differently.

When labor costs increase by mandate:

**Automation acceleration.** The calculation for replacing labor with capital shifts. Self-checkout, ordering kiosks, automated systems become viable at lower volumes. This was already occurring; the mandate changes the timing.

**Hour reduction.** Rather than eliminating positions (visible, discrete), employers reduce hours (distributed, less visible). Higher hourly rate multiplied by fewer hours can equal lower total compensation.

**Position elimination.** Entry-level positions designed for workers still building productivity become economically nonviable. The positions don't pay higher wages; they cease to exist.

**Price adjustment.** Businesses that cannot automate or reduce hours pass costs through prices. Nominal wage increases partially offset by higher costs of goods purchased.

**Geographic redistribution.** Effects concentrate where margins are thinnest—areas with lower economic activity, industries with lower value-add.

**Workload intensification.** Fewer workers handling equivalent output means higher productivity demand per worker.

These responses are systems seeking equilibrium under new constraints. Water flows downhill; incentives flow toward resolution.

## Visibility Asymmetry

An interesting feature of this mechanism: some effects are visible, others are not.

Visible:
- Workers who retain employment at higher wages
- Businesses that adjust and continue operating
- The numerical increase in the wage floor

Not visible:
- Interviews that never occur
- Positions never created
- Businesses never started
- Skills never acquired
- Experience never gained

Policy evaluation tends to weight visible effects heavily and invisible effects lightly. You can only measure what manifests.

The worker who keeps their job at $15/hour can be interviewed. The worker who never gets hired exists only as a statistical shadow, a counterfactual. Both are equally real in the mechanism. They are not equally real in discourse.

## Narrative Persistence

The narrative "minimum wage helps workers" persists across decades. This persistence is itself a phenomenon worth observing.

Narratives persist when they resonate with enough interest-models to sustain themselves. Not because they're true or false, but because they're useful to enough participants.

Who finds this narrative useful?

- **Political actors**: Visible gesture of intention, costs distributed and deferred
- **Incumbent workers**: Reduced competition from those willing to work at lower rates
- **Organized labor**: Contract structures often reference minimum wage as baseline
- **Capital-intensive competitors**: Relative advantage when labor costs rise uniformly

Multiple parties benefit from the same narrative for different reasons. The narrative sustains itself through this convergence.

**The claim-negation pattern operates here**: The claim "this helps workers" is structurally coupled to its negation. The more confidently held, the more precisely it predicts the axis of harm. The intention to help creates the friction that produces its opposite—not through hypocrisy but through the ordinary operation of the mechanism.

## Information Horizons

Populations facing constrained circumstances often support interventions that further constrain their circumstances. This is the natural result of optimizing within a limited horizon.

If your model is "wages are set by employer choice," then mandating higher wages appears to solve low wages. The model is incomplete, but it's not irrational given the information available.

If your model is "employment is a system seeking equilibrium under constraints," then mandating higher wages appears as perturbation with predictable adjustment dynamics. This model requires more abstraction, more distance.

A person standing in a valley sees different terrain than a person on a ridge. The valley perspective isn't wrong—it's local. The population most affected by these dynamics tends to have the least access to the abstractions that would reveal them. This is the structure of knowledge itself—abstraction requires distance.

---

## The Pattern Generalized

This structure—intervention producing dynamics orthogonal to intention—appears across domains:

- Price controls on housing affect supply dynamics
- Trade restrictions affect consumer prices and industry structure
- Credentialing requirements affect market entry
- Transfer programs affect incentive gradients around productivity

The mechanism operates independently of intention. Systems respond to constraints in ways that don't respect the purpose behind those constraints.

---

## Conclusion

A minimum wage law is a price floor that prohibits transactions below a threshold. Workers whose productivity falls below that threshold lose access to employment transactions. Systems respond through automation, hour reduction, position elimination, price adjustment, and redistribution.

Those who support minimum wage increases optimize within their information horizon. Those who oppose them optimize within a different horizon. Neither horizon is complete. The mechanism operates regardless.

The worker producing $12 of value per hour cannot sustain employment at $15 per hour. That's subtraction.

## Framework Elements Demonstrated

This sample applies:

1. **Strip Moral Framing → Expose Mechanism**: Removed "helping workers" overlay to reveal price floor mechanics
2. **Trace the Arithmetic**: V vs M calculation, individual capability = 1
3. **Show Interventions Produce Their Opposite**: System responses that offset or reverse intention
4. **Identify Perspective-Switching Exploits**: Visible beneficiaries vs invisible effects
5. **Identify Resonance Artifacts**: Narrative persistence through convergent interest-models
6. **Information Horizons**: Different vantage points producing different models, none complete
7. **The Claim-Negation Coupling**: "Helps workers" claim structurally coupled to harming workers; intention creates conditions for its opposite
8. **Identity Lived, Not Claimed**: The louder the claim "we help workers," the more it compensates for the mechanism producing the opposite. The policy advocates who most vocally claim worker-advocacy are precisely those whose position depends on worker problems persisting (see samples/name-negation-tendency.md, samples/identity-lived-not-claimed.md)
9. **The Finality Tell (implicit)**: The narrative "minimum wage helps workers" feels like an answer—it closes inquiry rather than opening it. That closure feeling is diagnostic: a layer has been added (moral framing) rather than removed (mechanism exposed)
