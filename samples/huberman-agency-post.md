# You Don't Lack Agency—Your Choices Just Aren't Aligned With Reality

Andrew Huberman recently posted about "junkyard dogs"—those rare high performers who thrive despite poor conditions. His advice: you're probably not one of them, so build resilience and use tools that work.

Sounds practical. But practicality depends on following through—and following through is exactly what varies between people. The advice is information. Whether it becomes useful depends entirely on the individual's choices.

There's something in the framing worth unpacking.

**The hidden assumption is that some people have more agency than others.** The gifted few versus the rest of us. If you're in the "rest" category, compensate with external tools.

But what if the capacity for choice doesn't vary at all?

Consider an alternative model: **freedom of choice is innate. What varies is its alignment with reality.**

Everyone chooses, constantly. The person who appears stuck isn't failing to choose—they're choosing something other than what they claim to want. They optimize for comfort while saying they want achievement. They protect self-image while saying they want growth. Their choices are fully active. The alignment just isn't where they say it is.

This reveals something deeper.

**External conditions are substrate, not script.**

Conditions set the terrain. They don't dictate the path.

The same external circumstance—poverty, illness, bad timing—produces radically different outcomes across individuals. The variable isn't "how much willpower do you have." The variable is: are your actual choices aligned with the reality you're operating in? And with the goals you claim to hold?

"I want to succeed but I keep failing" often means: "I'm choosing comfort over the exposure that success requires." The hidden choice explains the behavior. Nothing is missing. The choosing is working perfectly—just not toward what you say you want.

**So what about tools?**

Here's where the framing matters practically:

- **Deficiency frame:** You lack innate talent, so tools compensate for what you don't have.
- **Alignment frame:** You have full freedom to choose, and tools extend the reach of whatever those choices are aligned toward.

Same action—use the tools. Different psychological substrate.

The first requires accepting inadequacy as your starting point. The second requires confronting what your choices are actually aligned with—which is often harder, because it might reveal you've been choosing comfort while telling yourself you want achievement.

---

**The "junkyard dogs" aren't a different species.**

They're people whose choices happened to align with survival and growth under adverse conditions—often because alternatives were removed. When comfort isn't available, you stop choosing it.

This doesn't make adversity good. It makes adversity *revealing*. It strips away comfortable options, so you finally see what you choose when comfort isn't on the menu.

You don't need adversity to achieve alignment. You need honesty about what your choices are actually aligned with. And then—if you genuinely want to redirect them—tools are amplifiers, not compensators.

The junkyard dogs aren't more gifted. They just had nowhere comfortable to point their choices.

**There's a deeper structure here.**

"Build resilience" and "use tools that work" are actions. Actions require sustained, aligned choosing. But sustained, aligned choosing is exactly what the framing suggests you lack—otherwise you'd already be a junkyard dog.

The advice presupposes the shift it's trying to produce.

"You struggle with X, so do X" would actually be honest—it names the reality that the capacity exists, you're just not choosing it. The struggle is in the alignment, not the ability.

But most self-improvement advice has a different shape: "You lack X for achieving A, so do B"—where B quietly requires X. The deficiency is assumed, then the prescription demands what's supposedly missing.

**The identity pattern operates here too**: The "junkyard dogs" aren't claiming to be exceptional. They're just acting. The moment someone starts identifying as a junkyard dog, the dynamic shifts—they're now performing the identity rather than living it. The ones who actually embody it need no label; the label would be a distraction from the doing.

The question that gets skipped: what shifts alignment in the first place? Not "what should you do once aligned"—that part is obvious once you're there. But what causes the shift from pointing at comfort to pointing at growth?

The junkyard dog observation hints at one answer: removing comfortable alternatives forces the redirection. But that's descriptive, not prescriptive. You can't advise someone to "have their options removed."

What remains is the harder path: seeing clearly where your choices actually point—without the story you tell yourself about them—and discovering whether that seeing, by itself, shifts anything.

Sometimes it does.

*Freedom of choice is innate. What varies is its alignment with reality—external conditions, internal truths, stated goals. Tools don't compensate for missing agency; they extend the reach of whatever alignment you've achieved.*

## Framework Elements Applied

1. **Constant-Variable Distinction**: Freedom of choice is constant; alignment is the variable. The "high agency" framing smuggles quantity where direction operates.
2. **Substrate-Script Distinction**: External conditions are terrain, not instructions. They constrain but don't determine.
3. **Identity Lived, Not Claimed**: The junkyard dogs aren't claiming to be exceptional—they're acting. The identity pattern predicts that those who start claiming "I'm a junkyard dog" will shift from embodying to performing.
4. **The Self-Defeating Advice Structure**: "Build resilience" presupposes the capacity it's trying to produce. The advice assumes the shift already occurred.
5. **The Finality Tell (implicit)**: The advice "you're not a junkyard dog, so compensate" provides relief through classification. The relief is a layer settling, not clarity achieved. What gets closed: inquiry into what actually shifts alignment.
6. **Compression-Distortion**: "Junkyard dog" compresses a complex relationship between conditions, alignment, and revealed capacity. The memorable label propagates; the mechanism (removal of comfortable alternatives forcing alignment revelation) doesn't.

**Structural connection**: See samples/tools-as-amplifiers.md for the full exponential model (O = e^(A × T × t / Δt)) that formalizes how alignment differences compound through tools. See samples/identity-lived-not-claimed.md for why the labeling ("junkyard dog") shifts the dynamic.
